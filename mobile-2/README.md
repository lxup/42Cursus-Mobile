# 🌦️ Mobile 2 – Weather App: API & Data Management with Expo

This module is the third step of the 42 Piscine Mobile, where you’ll integrate **real-time weather data**, **geolocation**, **search-based lookup**, and **error handling** into your **Weather App** using **React Native with Expo**.

You’ll also start using external APIs (Open-Meteo), manage dynamic data, and handle edge cases to build a fully functional and resilient mobile weather experience.
